This is an alarm clock program, created using python. It helps us to set a single alarm. In future I may work on multiple alarms. As a real time alarm clock we can choose the alarm sound.
Sop button is used to top the alarm clock ( closes the app ).
The packages that are used here are:
=> Pygame --> Music for alarm sound
=>Tkinter --> Graphical User Interface
=>Time --> To know about time and to get the alarm logic
Pygame Module:
Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries designed to be used with the Python programming language.

Tkinter Module:
Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.

Time Module:
There is a popular time module available in Python which provides functions for working with times, and for converting between representations. The function time.time() returns the current system time in ticks since 00:00:00 hrs January 1, 1970(epoch).
